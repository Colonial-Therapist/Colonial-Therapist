# Colonial-Therapist

Colonist management tool.

The inspiration was the [Dwarf-Therapist](https://github.com/Dwarf-Therapist/Dwarf-Therapist) project for the game [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) ([steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/)).

Tool on mod [MineColonies](https://minecolonies.com/) for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/).

This program allows you to analyze the state of your colony. Who works where, the needs and happiness of citizens.
